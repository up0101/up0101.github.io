I notice I crave attention, touch, and security when something's wrong in my life, and about never come back to the topic of relationships otherwise.

I have two ideas for the mechanics at play.

[One]{.smallcaps} flavour of wrong in my life is not being good enough. That's like when I'm not making progress at research, when I'm stuck in the interviewing hell, when I can't grok the dance or melody. Another way to say it is not being in the flow, not *moving* forward — not being able, after exerting effort, to say that was good.

Here, love is an external voice saying "you're good actually". "I care about *you*; your work is mere curiosity; achievements as meaningful as pebbles on the beach."

[The]{.smallcaps} other way of wrong is when I feel bad.  Maybe I'm nauseous, feverish, ill, tired, feeling jaded. I think the key here is not feeling in control—empowered—to fix the problem. When it doesn't seem like there's anything in particular I can do to feel better.

I think there's a possibility of melting into someone's arms and instantly feeling well. I can't do that at the moment.

What I can do is (a) redirect my attention to the other person; their smell; their caress—less attention on my woes makes for an instant better. Or (b) play a game.

To explain the latter, I have to say that for me, cuddling gets boring quickly. Like after 5 minutes. So I maybe talk, but mostly focus on sensory sensations (when talking, voice vibrations) and try to move in an interesting way. My best sort of cuddle is not placidly lying together, it's more like a gaga improv. Dogs are good at this, people on average not. One can go halfway by moving in an interesting way around someone just lying there, but interaction is of course more interesting. Thus, a \[movement\] game.

This second scenario is all about redirecting attention. I think people interaction isn't a very special way to do that, but maybe is somewhat special in that it is comparatively hard for me to devalue.

It looks like my desire for people often comes from trying to get myself out from the red. That makes it compulsive and narrow-minded.

When I'm looking at people from a good place, it's more akin to the intellectual curiosity I feel when seeing a new problem or book. I'm curious! engaged! but also I don't mind. There's a lightness in that.
