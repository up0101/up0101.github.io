title: I don't actually want to have sex with autists

For the longest time I felt attracted to autistic people. But also their autistic features repelled me: they were less embodied, context-aware, emotional then I were. And our sex never really worked.

So here's an idea: I don't actually want to have sex with autists. What I crave is validation-identification-sameness and a permission to play.

I am not a free man. I am bound by an internalised ghost of my mother who is never satisfied by whatever I do. I find it hard to do things I'm not good at; play is almost verboten.

Autists play so freely I could cry. They choose a thing and are fascinated. They learn all about it. They play hard. Intense.

I work hard, and I envy them so.

When I get emotionally close to an autistic, I often feel stronger than them, more in charge. And what I want is to hug; nuzzle; play. This is not sexual — this is adoration for what they are and what they do (the same I don't have).

And it's like — I feel myself in them. "I used to do that too", I think watching them. I project my child out and hug it.

When I can watch them play day by day and avoid being smitten, something in me learns too.

PS: I'm not saying I never want to have sex with autistics; I'm saying I'm disentangling me liking them as above from sexual desire.
