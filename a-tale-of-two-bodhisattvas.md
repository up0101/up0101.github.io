title: A tale of two bodhisattvas

\[epistemic status: heresy\]

Buddhists suggest that suffering is caused by craving and aversion. It is indeed easy to see how wishing for something you can't have leads to frustration. To combat this, Christian traditions suggest moderation and modesty. Buddhism goes on to say that all forms of desire can be harmful and one is better off without them; basic reasoning being (a) it's much easier to want something than to get something so one defaults to being in the red and (b) running on the hedonic treadmill makes one ever more fragile.

So, abolish craving and aversion! Meditate to reprogram your autonomous emotional processing into equanimity!

But can one retain agency while being equanimous? Historic accounts of bodhisattvas strongly suggest so: while on reaching enlightenment some have chosen to move to a higher realm in a flash of dazzling light, some stayed -- and have always behaved as if they wanted to do good (1).

If one feels no craving or aversion, one cannot prefer particular world-states -- they can't compare them. Then one cannot exhibit goal-oriented behaviour or agency (2).

How to resolve the contradiction of (1) and (2)?

## A tree bodhisattva

Consider a tree. When we talk of a tree to a child, we say: "look, it's reaching for the sun! It wants to grow ever larger and closer to the sun because it wants to be warm!". The tree of course doesn't want anything. It's a tree: a mechanism completely specified by its genetic code and environment. No subjective experience; just wood.

```
A TREE
Internal description: <wood>
External description: reaching for the sun
```

Thus, idea one: an enlightened person becomes a tree. They behave such that other people ascribe them goals, but their internal experience is void. Perhaps a ficus void.

## A webcam bodhisattva

Now consider a webcam. It has a pixel array: when light hits a particular pixel, it changes electrical conductivity. This we measure, digitise, and use in video calls.

When a person looks at the webcam's picture, they see faces, facial expressions, emotions, experience symbolic and emotional context anchored to the picture. A webcam doesn't care: it only has pixels. Red, green, ochre? Dark or light? Pixels.

Buddhists talk of non-attachment and letting thoughts, feelings, qualia come and go: not chasing after them, not running away from them.

A "webcam" of a human mind is exactly that. It sees pictures from our eyes; our thoughts are just a few more lines of pixels to it; bodily sensations yet more pixels. It doesn't ascribe meaning, doesn't interpret, doesn't reach for something -- it's as pure spectator as there is.

That covers equanimity, but not agency. For agency: the [PNSE paper](http://www.nonsymbolic.org/PNSE-Article.pdf) suggests that enlightened people draw the boundaries of their conciousness such that they do not experience agentic or symbolic behaviour subjectively while still retaining the appropriate mind "modules".

Thus, idea two: bodhisattva is a webcam in an agentic body. The input layer is subjectively experienced, while hidden layers (corresponding to object recognition, adding context to picture, prediction, evaluation) are, well, hidden.

## Captain Spock

Kahneman proposes a model differentiating autonomous/quick/emotional and slow/symbolic processing. This offers another way out: a bodhisattva may feel no emotions w.r.t. world-states, but rationally evaluate and choose them.

The crux here is "really" not feeling instead of repressing. Considering the [Culudasa debacle](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/10/16/is-enlightenment-compatible-with-sex-scandals/) it's unclear how much meditation helps with that.
