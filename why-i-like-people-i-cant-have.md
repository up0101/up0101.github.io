## I like what I can't have

I only romantically like people I can't have.

That is, those I do like seem to evade contact. They do it by ghosting and refusing to meet citing business. When we do meet, they are keen, even eager, to talk, but intimacy is hard to broach.

When \[other\] people express attraction to me, I normally feel put off and disgusted. Often, it feels as if a person is trying to use an image of me to satisfy their emotional needs.

---

Sometimes the "can't have" dynamic takes ridiculous forms, like me meeting three people independently, and them all leaving for another country in the span of a few months.

A few acquaintances respond to my messages perhaps once a month or every few months. I set up a bot to ping them automatically because feeling passively rejected feels bad and a bot doesn't mind.

Looking back at my relationships, I devised a maxim: 

> If we don't kiss within 24 hours of meeting, we shan't be together.

i.e. if the both of us don't decide to go forward with intimacy immediately, we will never enter a relationship.

Why does it work like this? Some hypotheses:

- One quickly understands if this person works for them. Formally, value of information hits asymptote at 24 hours.
- (1) People have limited windows when they are interested in a relationship;
  (2) You can only advance a relationship when you meet;
  (3) I don't meet with people that often.
- I need immediate escalation:
    - To feel safe (that the other person is committed as well)
    - Because I'm hungry for closeness
    - Because I can't handle medium-closeness relationships: I can only do far (acquaintance) and close (partner). If the latter doesn't clearly seem to work out, I discard the prospect.
- My affect is polarized. I either reject a person hard or like them hard.
    - The latter either scares them off;
    - Or I realize they are (comparatively) uninterested and skulk off.
- Because I'm not good at keeping in touch with people I don't meet with for external reasons.

Now if we don't kiss, and if the other person is subjectively salient enough, I'll keep trying to meet with them for a while.

Why would they ghost me when I'm settling a meeting, and want to talk with me when we do meet?

- I am overwhelming them
- Good people are hard to get an audience with because they are busy with their nice things
- They are depressed and have limited total energy
- They aren't sociable and have a limited budget for socialization
- They want to hunt me and not be given me from the outset

Why is it hard to broach intimacy?

- They are afraid of intimacy
- They are not gay enough
- [Pure numbers](http://plaza.ufl.edu/piyush82/girlfriend.pdf): wanting to touch a person or have emotional contact with them are two additional filters dividing the already scarce pool by a large factor

Why do I keep doing this?

- Salient people are scarce. Exploiting the few I know of is rational as opposed to exploring about for new ones.
- An impossible love discharges the obligation to love and saves one from being dependent (via *Sadly, Porn*)

    <br>I ask these questions because knowing is easier than acting; and I ask myself because I can't have anybody, duh.

## What I can have is depressed

My basic criteria for liking a person is I want to keep talking to them. That is, our communication flows fluidly, as opposed to roughly, in jerks and stops, or unevenly.

This aesthetic applies broadly to the topics we talk about, opinions expressed, smoothness of speech, and body language.

Of the close relationships I have had, 100% of them have been with depressed people.

One way to interpret that is they are safe. I can easily overpower/overwhelm them and thus feel unthreatened. Or better than them.

More generally, safety = trust + control ‚ûù 1. In this model, the partner's depression lessens the need for control since they don't have too much energy one might need to contain. (A body that isn't moving moves smoothly, in a sense.)

---

One issue I have with relationships is it seems I often have to restrict myself.

This happens with aggression and speech.

Aggression goes like this: I express aggression, my partner breaks down in sobs, I feel guilty and obligated to take care of them, and I feel resentment (I want to be who I am, not present a PG-13 front).

As for speech:

I like my expressive power. I cherish being able to talk about the freezing fluorescent rain of my emotions; I enjoy figuring out the logical structure of the argument and doing back-of-the-napkin calculations. I feel unhappy when I have to forfeit some of the ways I think, some of the ways I *am*, to be understood.

## üêã; what to make of this

- External structures that keep you bumping into people are great ways to support relationships
- Likewise, being in a position that passively nets one new people might be nice
- Factoring social needs somewhat works
- Therapy works
- Having a good life works
- Bots work but probably don't convert people well but are cheap so net positive
