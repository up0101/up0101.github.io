\[epistemic status: definition\]

I habitually use the concept of a "high grade person" (HGP) to describe my preferences in people. This post elaborates.

## Understanding

A necessary but not sufficient characteristic of a high grade person is they understand everything you say (maybe more).

This means you quickly build a structure of mutual understanding and get to talking (doing) interesting things.

This is not the same as them knowing all the things you know -- high fluid intelligence and buffer size let one infer 80% of things in non-technical conversations, and get explanations of the remaining 20% in a few seconds.

In cases of high inferential distance, openmindedness will also be important. I find it to be useful for interesting things anyway, so this doesn't increase our requirements base.

Speaking of inferential distance, shall you disagree, a HGP is debuggable: they have gears-level models they can explain and double crux.

## And progress

The second chore feature is high grade people do visible impactful work.

(Visible inasmuch as is useful to them. I'm only specifying this to differentiate from people nobly suffering for a cause incognito.)

They are agentic, do not hesitate, do make progress toward their goals.

I notice many also do "interesting" things like extreme sports, travel, DIY, fancy dress, black mass orgies, etc. This suggests a certain disinhibition w.r.t. social norms. While being adept in these, they do not hold these as part of their identity: any particular such activity is not what defines them.

I also notice I devalue people who make progress in specific "sandbox" areas devoid of wide recognition/status/money: that's most purists (see also atheism, open-source software).

## Noticing

You often *see* a HGP as they enter the room. It's the same kind of aura or feel that you sense when, say, a restaurant's owner is serving guests in line with the other waiters. It's easy to pick them out.

## Not necessarily nice

Nothing said above suggests a HGP ought be nice. In fact, a sociopath CEO fits the bill exactly.

So it is; niceness is orthogonal.

Niceness is about collaboration, projecting a warm-fuzzy-I-value-you field, being trustworthy; interacting with a nice person has positive valence in expectation. Unrelated.

One can say I avoid low-grade people since they are uninteresting and/or drag me down, and avoid not-nice people because they're unpleasant to be around.

So:

**A high grade person is literally a high grade executive**.
