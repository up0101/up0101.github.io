title: Some suicidal ideas

I thought it would be interesting to inventory and track my suicidal concepts (=reasons for suicide and maybe vision of execution) over time. Here goes.

## I'm destined to hurt

I have a few incurable genetic diseases that make my life worse. Allergy is one. Allergy means being unable to eat many foods, live with animals, and spending 2-3 months of a year in a kind of a chronic fever.

Skin stuff is another. Parents tell my early months of life were alike to those of a leper: I was covered in crusts oozing with pus and blood. It's a wonder I survived, and doubly a wonder I don't remember much. It did get better... but.

I'm not optimistic about my psyche either. I've been depressed for, by various estimates, 7 to 12 years now, it's not really getting better<sup>\[citation needed\]</sup>, and there's a bunch of comorbid stuff like high sensitivity, high openness, ASD all suggesting genetic genesis.

So here's the thesis: I'm not really fit to live. In most worlds, I wouldn't even survive early childhood. The issue's in the DNA; the very best to be done is palliative care. There's no sense in carrying on pretending I could live a happy life—my living moments will always be smeared with pain. Best leave living to those who can.

A miniature:

> I recall seeing a man walking his dog. I was at first some distance behind them and noticed a kind of a weirdly wobbling spot in my vision. As I got closer, it resolved into a dog. Or rather half a dog. Its hind was propped on a wheeled frame; its rear legs atrophied and wobbling like dead tentacles as it ran ahead. As a tiny dog, it had to run to keep up with the owner, and it did, and it looked happy.

> I, I was revolted. Naseous. Better to die than to live this mockery of a life.

## Their love is fake

My relatives were big on telling me they love me and I'm their life. The next moment they manipulated me into emotionally supporting them, sucking me dry as they did.

So after a little while their platitudes began to ring hollow. I wanted away from those parasites wearing a plastered-on smile and making me bear their tens of years' worth of grievances. There was no way out.

Then helpless rage I felt. Here's the fantasy:

> I'd poison the food at home to get mother. As she'd be frothing from the mouth in agony I could be about landing at the city my other blood family lived. Grandmothers I could cull with a knife to the throat: they were big on emotional violence; soft physically. Father, grandfather — easiest to go with blunt trauma, like a pipe to the head from the back. Also carry pepper spray for assurance. Once down, cut throat. This leaves the children, the stepbrother and sister. I could basically kick them till they die. Then it's either poison or firearm for myself. I think grandfather had an old pistol...

## Nobody wants me

Consider there's no one there who would consistently, systemically, purposefully want to talk to me. No one. No one cares. Best I have is people who don't mind to.

Like we're in the same place, in the same time, yeah, sure, exchange a couple words, maybe a pat. My role is kind of a comforter. Like a cat. You like to pet him when he's around, when he's gone you don't give a second thought ever.

There's the same thing with work. I work, I pour my heart out, do my best, do what's right. Others? They're like okay, cool, great!.. — nice weather today, eh. Oh my, look at the time, gotta pick kids from school, ta-ta!

So it's like I have a rich inner world... and nobody, nobody gives a fuck.

Sometimes they make noises as if they do. It either goes as above (their love is fake) or they don't really go through. They're like I like you... please book a meeting at least a month in advance, here's my secretary's number, thanks. Oh I'm afraid I got to reschedule, I'm out in the country this week. Oh, but please do keep up in your futile efforts to raise my attention! I like that, y'know.

If nobody wants me, my life has no value. Econ 101.
