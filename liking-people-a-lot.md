title: Liking people a lot

I notice a pattern: sometimes I like a person a lot. After a while, I either feel disenchanted, scrub the memory, and move on; or else the person shrinks away from me. Here's an attempt to cog this out.

A lot of the time, when I'm with someone, doing something, I'm only in touch with a very narrow part of them. I mean to say — I don't care about someone's backstory when I'm trying to hold an intellectual conversation. Their emotions can even be distracting, in the way of what really interests me. Vice versa, when I want an emotional conversation, intellectual stonewalling is infuriating. But this is not about intellectual/emotional: it's about a person being whole, and me only wanting to talk to a part.

To talk to a part is a means. It's not about the other person. When it's intellectual, it's curiosity, pursuit of argument, truth. When it's emotional, it's the swelling, lightness, bubbling, rage.

The other person is a cardboard cutout.

The usual therapeutic thing here would be to add relief, depth, light and shadow to the other person and see them as whole. That's exactly the place where I feel disenchanted and get away.

This is how I think it works:
- When I'm not covering it up, I notice a lot
- I identify strongly
- My attention gravitates to the negative
- I feel repulsed
- I flee

When something doesn't let me flee and makes me keep meeting and talking to them, I tend to build a workable relationship, though the process is not painless.

Above was endgame, kind of. What is the gambit? (and what do I sacrifice?)

First, how it starts. Sometimes, a person shows me kindness. Attention. They talk to me. They are smart. Confident, in their zone. We understand what each other says very well.

That's all it takes really. Kindness, sameness, my respect. Also this almost never happens.

When it does, I feel very, very happy. No one shows me kindness [that I can take in]; they do. This is one of the scarcest resources there. I must do all I can to have it.

Thus I sacrifice my detachment. And—that's an insight—this scares people.

A miniature to make it quite clear how this feels:

> My college calculus lecturer was nice. Kind of a cool uncle or maybe springy grandpa image. He lectured well, was quick with words, we shared a disdain for most of my class, it was nice to banter in breaks.
> 
> At some point I started to fantasise having sex with him on the auditorium table. Not erotic, rather compulsory. The right, correct thing to do. Or so it felt.
> 
> I had to give something in exchange for his care, and I was already doing my best in calculus, and clearly that was trivial and not enough. At least I had my body.

A therapist would say: "well, for you his care is so very valuable and scarce; but for him, it is aplenty, and so he gives it away. No need to offer your heart and soul; he will love you for a smile."

Hard to master moderation while starving.
